Official Code for  
**"Towards Interpretable and Accurate Breast Cancer Classification via Dual-Granularity Attention and Optimized Prototype Learning"**

## üìù Abstract

Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women globally, underscoring the critical importance of early detection and accurate classification. However, existing deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems often struggle to strike a balance between high classification accuracy and interpretability.

To address this trade-off, we propose **DGMHA-ProtoNet**, a novel framework that synergistically combines attention-enhanced feature representation with prototype-based interpretability.

- We design a **Dual-Granularity Multi-Head Attention (DGMHA)** module to capture both coarse- and fine-grained long-range dependencies, thereby enriching feature expressiveness.
- For enhanced interpretability, we introduce a **Dual Latent Space Prototype Projection** mechanism that jointly leverages:
  - the shallow embedding space from the backbone, and  
  - the deep embedding space from the attention-enhanced layers,  
  enabling more precise mapping between prototypes and representative training patches.

Extensive experiments on the **BreaKHis** dataset demonstrate that our method achieves **superior classification accuracy** while providing **faithful and intuitive visual explanations**, showcasing its potential for practical breast cancer diagnosis.
